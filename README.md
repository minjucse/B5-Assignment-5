Ride Booking System - Backend API
üéØ Project Overview
This project is a secure, scalable, and role-based backend API for a ride-booking system, similar to Uber or Pathao. It is built using Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and Mongoose. The system is designed to handle three distinct user roles: Rider, Driver, and Admin, each with specific permissions and functionalities.

The core features include a robust authentication system using JWT, role-based authorization for protecting routes, complete ride management from request to completion, and an admin panel for overseeing the entire system.

Key Features:
Authentication: JWT-based login with Access and Refresh Tokens stored in secure httpOnly cookies.
Role-Based Authorization: Custom middleware to protect routes based on user roles (Rider, Driver, Admin).
User Management: Admins can view all users and block/unblock their accounts.
Driver Lifecycle: Riders can apply to become drivers, and admins can approve or reject these applications.
Ride Lifecycle: Riders can request rides, drivers can accept and update ride status (PICKED_UP, IN_TRANSIT, COMPLETED), and riders can cancel their requests.

üõ†Ô∏è Setup & Environment Instructions
Prerequisites
Node.js (v18 or higher)
npm or yarn
MongoDB (either a local instance or a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)
Installation & Setup
Clone the repository:

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd ride-share-backend
Install dependencies:

npm install
Set up environment variables: Create a .env file in the root of the project and add the following variables. You can copy them from the .env.example file.

# .env.example
PORT=3000
DB_URL=mongodb://localhost:27017/ride_db

BCRYPT_SALT_ROUND=12
NODE_ENV=development

JWT_ACCESS_SECRET="your-access-secret-key"
JWT_ACCESS_EXPIRES="1d"
JWT_REFRESH_SECRET="your-refresh-secret-key"
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES="30d"
Build the project (for production):

npm run build
Run the server:

For development (with hot-reloading):
npm run dev
For production (after building):
npm start
The server should now be running on the port specified in your .env file.
