# ðŸš– Ride Booking System - Backend API

This project is a secure, scalable, and role-based backend API for a ride-booking system, similar to **Uber** or **Pathao**.  
Built with **Node.js**, **Express.js**, **TypeScript**, and **Mongoose**. It supports three primary roles: **Rider**, **Driver**, and **Admin** â€” each with dedicated permissions and endpoints.
